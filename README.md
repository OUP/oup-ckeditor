This repository was created as an investigation into enhancing the CK Editor functions within the Cloud CMS application licensed from Gitana
The code changes were made by Cognizant developers on behalf of OUP
The repository was not handed over to subsequent Cognizant developers who do no believe it is in use in production as of August 2024
In addition, the OUP instance of Cloud CMS is now running as a SaaS solution from Gitana using the current version, no longer a self-hosted instance
